### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**scttohara/scttohara** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building a website with Python/Django/Graphql/not-sure-about-storage/etc because I have a few command line games written that I think would be pretty fun through a web browser (i.e. the python_card_game, US_states-capitals_game, and one or two others). When it is up and working I'll have a link here 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to love myself better

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building a website with Python/Django/Graphql/not-sure-about-storage/etc because I have a few command line games written that I think would be pretty fun through a web browser (i.e. the python_card_game, US_states-capitals_game, and one or two others). When it is up and working I'll have a link here. Additionally, I am working on HackerRank, Euler project, and Leetcode problems to get better at problem solving with job interview type questions.

- ðŸŒ± At the moment I'm learning more Python, graphQL, more SQL, figuring out next steps in which database to learn, hoping the above-mentioned projects will help with that decision. 

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any project with python involved, anything mental health, Software as a Medical Device, and/or algorithm based would be awesome to help with. Just message me on Linkedin (https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-ohara/)
